# Texas_A-M_GPA_Calculator
This project helps a TAMU student calculate their GPA by
1. Plugging in the amount of classes they have
2. The name of each class
3. Plugging in the credit hour for each respective class

Summary: 
1. I learned to do nesting if statements
2. I learned to calculate the GPA for my school Texas A&M
